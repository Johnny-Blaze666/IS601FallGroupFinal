# Customer Journey
## Overview
Many business owners are hesitant to invest in cybersecurity because it does not by itself generate any money. To convince them to hire us, we must express the following:
* The value of having a well-maintained, secure network
    * Show the vulnerabilities we could prevent
    * Allow them to explore the harm that could occur if a threat exploits those vulnerabilities
    * Show the cost breakdown of NOT having a secure network for each attack
* Why is our value greater than that of our competitors
    * Up to date
        * Credentials
        * Any awards, certifications, challenges
    * Statistics
        * Attacks prevented
        * Testimonials
    * Customer service
        * Work one-on-one with the clients to develop a product that best suits their business
        * Educate our client on best practices
* Contact information and Pricing
